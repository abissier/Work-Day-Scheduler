# Work-Day-Scheduler

This work day scheduler allows users to plan each hour of their day. Each save button saves the corresponding line of text and saves it to local storage.
When the page loads it will check local storage to see if there are any existing items to add to the schedule and if so, set it to the appropriate time slot.
